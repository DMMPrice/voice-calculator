## Short Speech on Project
Good evening everyone! I think all of you might have used calculators. Of course u would have used! How about a voice calculator. In this age of AI and Alexa typing on calculators is kind of old fashioned. So we are bringing to u our idea of voice calculator that we have developed and brought to reality. A simple voice calculator is a device in which we just need to speak the expression to our laptop or phone or any other gadgets with a microphone and it would carry out the operation. I think there would be a question in all of ur head that how is that possible but with the help of  coding it is! we can exercise voice recognition technique and as we speak the words the calculation is carried out!

### Advantages
